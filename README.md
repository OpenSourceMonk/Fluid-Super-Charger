The Fluid Supercharger is a device that augments the energetic and structural properties of polar fluids passed through it. This includes, but is not limited to, deionised water, water-based solutions, and plasma. Scientific observations suggest that rainfall from thunderstorms yields superior results for plant growth when compared to traditional irrigation. Two phenomena are believed to contribute to this enhanced biological response: (1) the formation of nanoscale structured plasma toroids, known as plasmoids, and (2) the structuring of water into a hexagonal molecular arrangement. This structured water exhibits lower surface tension and improved cellular permeability, enabling enhanced hydration and biological uptake. By mimicking these natural effects, the Fluid Supercharger produces water with increased vitality for both plant and animal life.
